hello I hope my audible this file is part of my Software Development group project
I hope I am audible all this time I was trying to talk through my microphone but after a certain time it stops I don't know why it stops getting the answers but I want to keep the text converting
I am of this this file is part of my Software Development group project and this is a speech to text recognition file where I have used Python and flask to implement this and I am using Google speech to text library to convert the speech to text and saving it to the output.txt file and later I am retrieving the values and using

hi I am checking
hello this is a test file to check if the values that are being entered successfully or not so first of all what I am doing is I am using the Google speech to text library to convert speech into text and I am string it to the output of txt file later I am between those values and using it in my
I am having a set of hard coded answer in my database and data I am retrieving those answers
this is to check if the values are detecting in a loop so what I have done so far is I am using the Google speech to text library to convert this speech which I am talking into text and saving it to the output of txt file later I am retrieving that file and checking for the keywords that are matching with my hard coded answers in my database and if so if it matches I am getting giving a rating based on that and later finally I am giving feedback on it so I hope I am audible and this is working properly because I am

what I am trying to achieve there is I am trying to
I am trying to achieve here is I am trying to convert speech to text and I am storing it into an output the txt file later I am retrieving it and I am checking if the values in the output of txt file and the hard coded values in my database matches by checking for the keywords in the output of txt file later at the end if it matches I am giving a certain score and giving feedback for the user and I am developing this as part of my Software Development group project and I am developing practice interview practice application to check
trying to achieve here is I am trying to convert speech to text and I am storing it into an output.txt file later I am receiving the file and I am checking if the values in the output.txt file and the hard coded values in my database matches by the keywords which I have given if it matches what I do is
where is I am trying to convert
