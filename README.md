# Speech to Text Converter

This Python script converts speech input from the microphone into text and exports the recognized text to an output file named `output.txt`. 
It continuously captures speech input in a loop and appends the converted text to the output file. The script utilizes the `speech_recognition` 
library for speech recognition and the `pyttsx3` library for text-to-speech functionality.


## Dependencies

- `speech_recognition`
- `pyttsx3`
